As most people believe that NFT will create a new future, we feel the same way. However, NFT assets currently lack liquidity, and from the perspective of nature and its way of application, they are more like digital traditional commodities. In this case, it is difficult for them to involve in secondary trading, let alone form a long-term stable secondary market. In view of this, we have conducted a long-time research on NFT and thought about it in unique ways. We try to abstract out a POA mechanism based on perpetual combinatorial auction. By doing this, we create a NFT standardized circulation agreement. Moreover, we create a high-dynamic continuous auction mechanism for the pricing of NFT while ensuring rationality, integrity and basic liquidity, and convert its auction value into the mineral value generated by blockchain mining, realizing the standardized circulation of NFT assets. We will release the related source code and the Ecology brochure later. Welcome to discuss together!
